Available on the Elite plan and higher, SMS notifications can be set up for multiple recipients, so the right members of your team are instantly updated, regardless of where they are.

## Setting up SMS Notifications

To set up SMS notifications:

1. Log in to your [Comfyform dashboard](https://app.comfyform.com/forms).
2. Navigate to the [Forms](https://app.comfyform.com/forms) section and open the form you want to enable SMS notifications for.
3. Click on the "Notifications" tab.
4. Enter the phone numbers of the recipients who should receive SMS alerts.

### Customizing the SMS text

Customize the SMS text, utilizing field placeholders to include specific information from the submission. Remember, field placeholders correlate with the names of your form fields, allowing you to dynamically insert submission data into the SMS message. If you want to add the value of a `name` field to your SMS text, use this placeholder syntax: `{{name}}`.

You can also use our predefined texts in multiple languages which will include a link to the submission detail (coming soon).

#### Example SMS Text

`[Comfyform] You have a new form submission from your website SuperWeb from {{name}}. Check your email for more information.`
