- **Paid Accounts**: Amplify your outreach with up to 10 email recipients, aligning with the needs of growing businesses and teams.
- **Enterprise Accounts**: Obtain a custom number of recipients to match the scale of your operations, ensuring all stakeholders maintain situational awareness.

Each notification email contains all data from your form submission, enabling you to assess and react without any delays. And with thoughtful customization options, Comfyform lets you tailor the notification process to your specific requirements.

### Customizing the Email Subject and Text

Elevate your communication by personalizing the email notifications you receive from Comfyform. Flexibility is key to making each interaction count, and with Comfyform, you can change the subject line and introduction text of your email notifications to fit the tone and context of your business or project needs.

Here's how you can customize:

1. **Modify the Email Subject**: Make your email notifications instantly recognizable by crafting unique subject lines that reflect the purpose of the form or the urgency of the submission.

2. **Edit the Introduction Text**: Set the tone for your message by adding an introductory text. This helps in pre-framing the content of the email and can be a warm welcome or a professional preamble to the finer details of the submission.

## Automatic Reply-To Header

Make the follow-up process with form submitters as seamless as possible with Comfyform's thoughtfully integrated Reply-To feature. When your form includes crucial contact fields, Comfyform automatically sets a `Reply-To` header in your notification emails, providing you with a straightforward way to respond directly to the users who reached out.

If any of the following fields are included in a submission, our system recognizes them and configures the `Reply-To` header accordingly:

- mail
- email
- e-mail

Our case-insensitive matching ensures that even if the field is named `mAiL`, `Email`, or any other variation, the functionality remains intact.
