Ensure your audience feels acknowledged from the moment they engage with your form. With **Comfyform’s Autoresponder** feature, setting up an **automated email response** is effortless. Show your respondents that their submission has been received and **offer instant information, assurances, or next steps** to keep them informed and engaged. 

Customizing the early and concluding parts of your automated reply to reflect your brand’s voice, provide valuable information, or simply express gratitude for the submission, contributes to a seamless interaction that will impress users and encourage further engagement.

## Step by Step Guide to Set Up the Autoresponder

Creating an effective auto-response requires clear communication and anticipation of your audience's needs. Follow these instructions to start automating your email responses:

1. Log into the [Comfyform dashboard](https://app.comfyform.com/sign/in).
2. Navigate to the [Forms](https://app.comfyform.com/forms) section and select the form to which you wish to attach an autoresponder.
3. Click on the **Notifications** tab.
4. Find the **Autoresponder** section and click "Activate".
5. Enable and configure the Autoresponder:
   - **Use Custom Field Name:** Check this option to enable a new input where you can specify your form’s unique email input field name (if it differs from the [automatically detected ones](#email-field-detection)).
   - **Email Sender:** Specify the sender's name that will appear in your recipient's inbox, making the email recognizable as coming from your brand or organization.
   - **Email Subject:** Craft a compelling subject indicating the mail is a confirmation of the submission.
   - **Email Intro:** Write the introductory part of your email. It could be a warm welcome, thank you message, or any relevant information to provide at the beginning of your message.
   - **Attach Submission:** Tick this option if you want the submitted data included in the auto-response email, placed between the intro and outro sections. This helps reinforce transparency and allows users to review their submission.
   - **Email Outro:** Pen down the concluding part of your email. This is where you can reiterate gratitude, provide further instructions, or next steps.
   - **Reply-To Address:** Set this to your business or support email to manage any follow-up inquiries or correspondence.
6. Save your settings by clicking the "Save changes" button.

## Email Field Detection

For the autoresponder to function correctly, it's imperative that your form contains a field to collect the user's email address. By default, Comfyform detects standard field names for email inputs, which are case insensitive and include: 

- `email`
- `e-mail`
- `mail`

However, if your form uses a custom field name for the email (e.g., `business_email`), check the **Use Custom Field Name** option to enable a new input where you can specify your form’s unique email input field name.

## Testing

To ensure your autoresponder works flawlessly:

- **Validate the Process:** Submit a test entry through your form and check whether the autoresponder email is correctly sent to the entered email address.
- **Review Email Content:** Examine both the introductory and concluding parts for tone, accuracy, and completeness.
- **Check the Response Time:** Assess if the email response is sent promptly, enhancing the user experience.

## Best Practices

Make the most out of your autoresponses by adhering to these recommendations:

- **Maintain Professionalism:** Ensure the language and tone of your message align with your brand.
- **Be Informative:** Offer value in your message, whether through information or instructions.
- **Stay to the Point:** Keep your message clear and concise.
