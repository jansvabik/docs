Maintain the integrity of your form submissions and prevent spam by setting up **Comfyform's Disposable Email protection**. This feature, available exclusively to users on the Elite plan, automatically **filters out submissions from temporary and disposable email services**, ensuring your database remains populated with only genuine entries.

## Enabling Disposable Email Filter

1. Log in to your [Comfyform dashboard](https://app.comfyform.com/sign/in).
2. Navigate to the [Forms](https://app.comfyform.com/forms) section.
3. Select the form you wish to secure.
4. Click on the **Security** tab.
5. Locate the **Disposable Email** section.
6. Click on "Activate" and check the box to enable Disposable Email protection.
8. Click on the **Save changes** button.

## Step 3: Understand How It Works

With Disposable Email protection active, Comfyform will validate the email addresses submitted through your forms in real-time. Submissions containing email addresses from known disposable email providers will be flagged and treated as spam. This assures you that every form submission is from a legitimate source, enhancing your email list quality and campaign effectiveness.

## Step 4: Test Your Protection

It's important to verify that Disposable Email protection is working as intended.

- Test your form by submitting an entry with an email address from a known disposable email provider (like [Temp-mail](https://temp-mail.org/), [Internxt](https://internxt.com/temporary-email), [Tempmailo](https://tempmailo.com/), or [Tempail](https://tempail.com/)).
- Check your Comfyform dashboard to confirm that the submission has been flagged as spam.

Testing ensures that your setup is effective in detecting and blocking unwanted spam submissions from temporary email addresses.
