Streamline the quality of submissions you receive with Comfyform's **Content Monitoring** feature. This protective layer enables you to **block certain types of content** that are not relevant or appropriate for your business needs. Whether it's industry-specific terminologies or general undesirable content, Comfyform allows you to **customize your content filters efficiently**.

<Warning>
We are in the process of developing this feature and will proceed with thorough testing to ensure its quality meets your expectations. We anticipate that it will be available by the end of February 2024. Stay tuned!

Below is a straightforward guide on how to set up Content Monitoring for your forms.

## Activating Content Monitoring

1. Sign in to your [Comfyform dashboard](https://app.comfyform.com/sign/in).
2. Access the [Forms](https://app.comfyform.com/forms) section and select the form you wish to apply content restrictions to.
3. Navigate to the **Security** tab.
4. In the **Content Monitoring** section, click "Activate" or "Modify" based on your current setup status.
5. Check the box to enable Content Monitoring.
6. Choose which types of content you wish to block from your form submissions:
   - **Crypto-Related**: for preventing cryptocurrency solicitations or spam.
   - **Porn-Related**: for filtering out adult content and maintaining professionalism.
   - **Drugs-Related**: to stop submissions regarding illegal drugs or pharmaceuticals.
   - **Fraud-Related**: to deter phishing attempts or financial fraud.
   - **Aggressive Marketing**: for stopping overly aggressive or spammy marketing content.
   - **Vulgarisms**: to ensure language used is appropriate and respectful.
   - **Off-Topic Specifics**: to keep submissions strictly on-topic, based on your niche or industry.
7. In addition to preset categories, input any custom words or phrases you want to block in the **Custom Words Blacklist** field. Separate them by comma.
8. Enable the **Link Analysis** option to have Comfyform additionally inspect any included links in submissions for the specified restricted content (available in [Elite subscription](https://comfyform.com/pricing/)).
9. Click the **Save changes** button to apply and activate your settings.

## How Content Monitoring Works

Content Monitoring scans the text inputs in your form submissions for the presence of identified blocked categories or custom-listed words. If a submission contains any flagged content, Comfyform will automatically mark it as spam. This process helps keep your submissions relevant and appropriate without manual oversight on every entry.

**We use AI for detecting content from the blocked categories. For Custom Words Blacklist we use simple text search.**

## Testing Your Content Monitoring Setup

To validate that your filters are doing their job:

- Submit a test entry containing content from your blocked categories or specific custom words.
- Check if the system correctly identifies and flags the submission as spam.

These tests will ensure that your configuration is effective and that you only receive content that meets your standards.
