Ensure your forms are safeguarded from bots without inconveniencing genuine users by integrating Turnstile, Cloudflare's **intelligent, invisible captcha solution**. Turnstile works **quietly in the background to detect bots**, eliminating the need for interactive captcha challenges. Setting up Turnstile with Comfyform is **simple and efficient**, offering robust security with a frictionless UX.

Here's your guide to implementing Turnstile in your Comfyform web forms.

## Step 1: Sign Up for Turnstile

To get started with Turnstile, you need to sign up for the service and obtain your site-specific keys. If your website is already registered with Cloudflare Turnstile, your Turnstile keys will be available in your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up?to=/:account/turnstile). In that case, you can [skip to the second step](#step-2-configure-turnstile-in-comfyform-dashboard). Otherwise:

1. Visit the [Turnstile page in Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up?to=/:account/turnstile).
2. Click "Add site" button.
3. Provide the **Site name** (e.g. My Super Website) so you can find it later easily.
4. Select or fill in the **Domain(s)** which you're going to use Turnstile protection on.
5. Select the **Widget Mode** how the protection should work:
    - **Managed**: Cloudflare will decide if an interactive challenge should be used.
    - **Non-interactive**: Users will just see a widget with a loading bar.
    - **Invisible**: Completely invisible challenge that does not require interaction.
6. Click on the "Create" button.

Cloudflare will provide you with two essential keys after finishing the setup:
- **Site Key**: Public key implemented on your site's frontend.
- **Secret Key**: Private key used for communication between the backend and the Turnstile service for validating requests from your site. Keep it secure and never reveal it publicly.

## Step 2: Configure Turnstile in Comfyform Dashboard

Once Turnstile is set up on Cloudflare, you need to configure it within your Comfyform settings.

1. Log into your [Comfyform dashboard](https://app.comfyform.com/sign/in).
2. Visit the [Forms](https://app.comfyform.com/forms) section and open the form you wish to secure.
3. Click on the **Security** tab.
4. Locate the **Turnstile** section and click "Activate" or "Modify", depending on the current status.
5. Input your **Secret Key** appropriately.
6. To save and enable Turnstile protection, click the **Save changes**.

## Step 3: Implement Turnstile on Your Site

To ensure the Turnstile security is operational, integrate the Turnstile script into your website's form pages according to [Cloudflare's documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/client-side-rendering/) and we'll handle the validation process.

## Step 4: Test Your Turnstile Integration

With Turnstile now active, it's important to ensure everything functions as intended:

- Test your forms to confirm that Turnstile is operational.
- Verify that submissions are processed appropriately, with bot traffic being filtered out.

These tests help ensure your security measures are non-intrusive to users while effectively guarding against automated threats.
