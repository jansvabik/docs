Take control over where your form submissions originate from with **Comfyform's Location Filter**. This feature lets you **restrict or permit** form submissions **based on the geographic location** of the submitter, allowing you to create a whitelist or blacklist of countries. It's an effective tool to focus your marketing efforts, comply with local regulations, or **prevent spam from specific regions**.

Follow the guidance below to set up Location Filter for your forms in Comfyform.

## Setting Up Location Filter

1. Start by logging in to your [Comfyform dashboard](https://app.comfyform.com/sign/in).
2. Head to the [Forms](https://app.comfyform.com/forms) section and select the form you wish to apply location-based filtering to.
3. Navigate to the **Security** tab.
4. Scroll to the **Location Filter** section.
5. Click "Activate" if not yet active, or "Modify" to edit existing settings.
6. Select the filter type:
   - **Whitelist**: Only submissions from selected countries will be accepted.
   - **Blacklist**: Submissions from selected countries will be blocked.
7. Choose the **Countries** you wish to apply the filter to by searching or browsing from the list.
8. Decide how you wish to handle submissions from **undetectable or other locations** â€” you can choose to either allow or block these submissions.
9. Save your preferences by clicking on the **Save changes** button.

## Understanding How Location Filter Works

Comfyform's Location Filter uses the IP addresses of form submitters to determine their country location. When you set up a whitelist, only submissions from countries on that list are accepted. Conversely, a blacklist denies submissions from the specified countries, reducing unwanted traffic or potential security risks effectively.

## Testing Your Location Filter

Ensure that your location-based filters are functioning correctly:

- Trial submissions from the included or excluded countries using VPNs or proxy services.
- Check the results in your Comfyform dashboard to verify that the submissions are being correctly allowed or blocked.

Testing ensures that only the submissions you want are getting through, and unwanted traffic is kept at bay.
