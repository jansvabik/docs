## How Link Inspection Works

Link Inspection works by evaluating URLs found within form submissions. It checks the content of linked pages to detect any connections to the content categories you've chosen to restrict, such as:

- Unsolicited marketing or promotional material
- Inappropriate or adult content
- Potentially fraudulent or phishing sites
- Other categories as determined by your content-monitoring preferences

If a link leads to content that violates your restrictions, the submission containing the URL will be automatically flagged as spam.

## Testing Your Link Inspection Setup

It's crucial to undergo testing after enabling Link Inspection:

- Submit test entries that include links you would expect to be flagged based on your filters.
- Confirm that submissions with suspicious links are marked appropriately in your Comfyform dashboard.

Successful testing ensures that not just the text content of submissions but also linked materials adhere to your content standards.
