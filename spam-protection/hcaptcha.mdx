Enhance your Comfyform's security by integrating hCaptcha, a **privacy-focused captcha service that helps distinguish humans from bots**. Setting up hCaptcha with your Comfyform is a straightforward process that shields your forms effectively **without compromising user experience**.

Here's a step-by-step guide to adding hCaptcha to your Comfyform web forms.

## Step 1: Register Your Site with hCaptcha

Firstly, you need to sign up for hCaptcha and register your site to receive the necessary keys for integration. If you've already registered your website, you can [skip to the second step](#step-2-configure-hcaptcha-in-comfyform-dashboard).

1. Visit [hCaptcha website](https://www.hcaptcha.com/).
2. Create an account or sign in if you already have one.
3. Open [Add Site](https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/sites/new?type=bot-management) in the Sites section.
4. Fill in your site details, including the domain name.
5. Select the hCaptcha behavior you want to use, Comfyform supports all of them:
    - **Always Challenge** (users will see a challenge on each request)
    - **Passive** (only scoreâ€“no visible challenges)
    - **99.9% Passive** (only challenge higher risk users)
6. Pick the preferred Passing Threshold, we recommend selecting the **Auto** option.
7. Complete the registration by clicking the "Save" button.

Upon completion, you will be provided with the Sitekey which is a public key for implementation on your site's frontend. For enabling the security in your Comfyform, you'll need to find your Secret Key in your hCaptcha [account settings](https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/settings). Note that the Secret Key may be displayed only once.

## Step 2: Configure hCaptcha in Comfyform Dashboard

With your hCaptcha Secret Key in hand, configure it within your Comfyform settings.

1. Log into your [Comfyform dashboard](https://app.comfyform.com/sign/in).
2. Access the [Forms](https://app.comfyform.com/forms) section and open the form you want to protect.
3. Click on the **Security** tab.
4. Locate the **Captcha** section and click on "Activate" or "Modify".
5. Choose **hCaptcha** as your provider.
6. Enter your **Secret Key** into the designated field.
7. Click the **Save changes** button to apply and activate hCaptcha protection.

## Step 3: Implement hCaptcha on Your Site

To activate hCaptcha on your site, you'll need to include the hCaptcha script in the HTML of your webpage or use a compatible plugin if your site runs a content management system. Refer to [hCaptcha Docs](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/) for comprehensive guidance on adding the widget code to your website.

## Step 4: Test Your hCaptcha Implementation

Once hCaptcha is set up on both your Comfyform dashboard and website, conduct thorough testing:

- Verify that the hCaptcha challenge is visible and functional within your forms.
- Test form submissions to check that the captcha is verified correctly and only genuine entries are allowed through.

Testing ensures that real users can submit your forms without hassle, while spammers and bots are kept at bay.
