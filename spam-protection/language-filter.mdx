Enhance the quality of your form submissions and manage international communication with ease using **Comfyform's Language Filter**. This feature enables you to either approve or block form submissions **based on the language used**, providing a sophisticated way to control your input stream. Whether you're looking to focus on specific markets or avoid language-related spam, our Language Filter is here to help.

Learn how to implement the Language Filter for your Comfyform with these straightforward steps.

## Configuring Language Filter

1. Access your Comfyform account by signing in at [Comfyform dashboard](https://app.comfyform.com/sign/in).
2. Navigate to the [Forms](https://app.comfyform.com/forms) section from the dashboard and choose the form you wish to apply language filtering to.
3. Click on the **Security** tab to view the security features offered.
4. Look for the **Language Filter** section.
5. Click "Activate" or "Modify" to set your Language Filter preferences.
6. Choose your filter type based on your requirements:
   - **Whitelist**: Only submissions in selected languages will be accepted.
   - **Blacklist**: Submissions in selected languages will be declined.
7. Select the **Languages** you wish to include in your filter.
8. Decide on how to manage submissions in **undetectable or other languages** â€“ options include allowing or blocking them.
9. Confirm your choices by clicking the **Save changes** button.

## Understanding Language Filter Functionality

The Language Filter operates by analyzing the text input in form submissions to detect the language used. Setting a whitelist allows only submissions in specified languages, while those not listed are blocked. On the other hand, a blacklist will enable all languages except those specified to be blocked, ensuring unwanted languages are filtered out.

## Testing Your Language Filter

Always test your form after setting up a new filter:

- Submit test entries using both included and excluded languages to ensure the Language Filter is operating correctly.
- Examine your Comfyform dashboard to check if submissions are being appropriately allowed or flagged based on your filter settings.

Testing confirms that your Language Filter is working effectively, giving you confidence in your setup.
