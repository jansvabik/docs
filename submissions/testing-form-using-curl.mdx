Easily verify your Comfyform setup, including email or SMS notifications, by utilizing [`curl`](https://curl.se/) to send test submissions from your command line. This straightforward tool allows you to simulate form submissions without the need for a web interface. Ensure you have `curl` installed on your computer to begin the testing process.

<Tip>
**What is curl**

[cURL](https://curl.se/) is a command-line tool and library for transferring data with URLs, supporting a variety of protocols like HTTP, FTP, and others, commonly used for downloading or uploading files and web services communication.

## Quick Test Command

Use the following command to send a test submission to your Comfyform endpoint:

```sh
curl -X POST https://api.comfyform.com/s/YOUR_FORM_ID \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-d '{"Full Name":"Elon Musk","Email":"musk@example.com","Message":"Delighted with Comfyform'\''s simplicity and efficiency."}'
```

Don't forget to replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with the actual ID of your form. Need to find your form ID? Simply head over to your [dashboard](https://app.comfyform.com/forms), select the form you'd like to test, and click on "Copy endpoint URL" â€“ it's that easy!
