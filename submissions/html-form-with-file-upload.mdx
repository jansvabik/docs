## Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Your Form Up for File Uploads

### Step 1: Start With Our Prepared Form Template

To begin accepting files through your Comfyform, ensure your HTML form includes the `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute. This specifies how the form data should be encoded when submitted.

Here's a sample form to get you started:

```html
<form action="https://api.comfyform.com/s/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="text" name="Full name" placeholder="John Doe">
    <input type="email" name="Email" placeholder="john.doe@example.com">
    <input type="file" name="Cover letter">
    <input type="file" name="Photos" multiple>
    <textarea name="Message" placeholder="Hello, I'd like to..."></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with the actual ID provided by Comfyform for your form. The `multiple` attribute on the `input` element allows users to select more than one file.

### Step 2: Secure Your Form with Honeypot Field

Insert the following security field above the submit button in your form to prevent spam:

```html
<!-- Start of a security code to prevent bot submissions -->
<div style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">
    <label for="emailAgainHpInput">If you're huuuman, ignore this field</label>
    <input type="email" name="YOUR_HONEYPOT_FIELD" id="emailAgainHpInput" placeholder="your@email.com" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="nopls" data-1p-ignore data-lpignore="true">
</div>
<!-- End of security code -->
```

Adjust `YOUR_HONEYPOT_FIELD` according to your form security settings in Comfyform.

### Step 3: Customize as Needed

Tailor the form to your preferencesâ€”modify fields, update placeholders, or implement custom styles. For HTML structure and styling tips, refer to our [code structure and styling guide for HTML forms](https://comfyform.com/blog/how-to-structure-and-style-form-html-code-correctly-ux/).

### Step 4: Deploy and Test

Once you have your form set up, deploy your website, and perform a test submission to ensure everything is functioning as intended.

## Final Code

Here's what your final form code should look like. Remember to replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` and `YOUR_HONEYPOT_FIELD` with the appropriate values.

```html
<form action="https://api.comfyform.com/s/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="text" name="Full name" placeholder="John Doe">
    <input type="email" name="Email" placeholder="john.doe@example.com">
    <input type="file" name="Cover letter">
    <input type="file" name="Photos" multiple>
    <textarea name="Message" placeholder="Hello, I'd like to..."></textarea>
    <!-- Start of a security code to prevent bot submissions -->
    <div style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">
        <label for="emailAgainHpInput">If you're huuuman, ignore this field</label>
        <input type="email" name="YOUR_HONEYPOT_FIELD" id="emailAgainHpInput" placeholder="your@email.com" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="nopls" data-1p-ignore data-lpignore="true">
    </div>
    <!-- End of security code -->
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Tips for a Seamless File Upload Experience

- **File Input Customization**: Tailor the file input fields to accept specific file types by using the `accept` attribute. For example, `accept="application/pdf"` for allowing only PDF files.
- **Max File Size**: Be mindful of the maximum file size allowed by Comfyform to prevent failed submissions. The maximum file size is currently set to 16MB.

## Protecting Against Bots

While Comfyform forms are automatically equipped with Honeypot security, it's crucial to include the provided security code snippet within your form to maintain this level of protection. This invisible field helps filter out bot submissions by providing a field that should only be filled out by automated scripts.

## Handling Multiple Files

When users need to upload more than one file, the `multiple` attribute is your friend. It allows for the selection of multiple files in a single input field, organized and uploaded together to Comfyform.
