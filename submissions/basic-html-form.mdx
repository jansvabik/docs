## Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing Your Form from Scratch

### Step 1: Start With Our Prepared Form Template

Comfyform provides a simple HTML form template you can use as a starting point. Later, we'll include the honeypot field to help filter out bots efficiently. 

```html
<form action="https://api.comfyform.com/s/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="Full name" placeholder="John Doe">
    <input type="email" name="Email" placeholder="john@example.com">
    <textarea name="Message" placeholder="Hello, I'd like to..."></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Copy and paste the entire form code provided above into the HTML file where you want your form to appear. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with the ID you receive when you create your form in the Comfyform dashboard.

### Step 2: Secure Your Form with Honeypot Field

Insert the following security field above the submit button in your form to prevent spam:

```html
<!-- Start of a security code to prevent bot submissions -->
<div style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">
    <label for="emailAgainHpInput">If you're huuuman, ignore this field</label>
    <input type="email" name="YOUR_HONEYPOT_FIELD" id="emailAgainHpInput" placeholder="your@email.com" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="nopls" data-1p-ignore data-lpignore="true">
</div>
<!-- End of security code -->
```

Adjust `YOUR_HONEYPOT_FIELD` according to your form security settings in Comfyform.

### Step 3: Customize as Needed

Tailor the form to your preferencesâ€”modify fields, update placeholders, or implement custom styles. For HTML structure and styling tips, refer to our [code structure and styling guide for HTML forms](https://comfyform.com/blog/how-to-structure-and-style-form-html-code-correctly-ux/).

### Step 4: Deploy and Test

Once you have your form set up, deploy your website, and perform a test submission to ensure everything is functioning as intended.

## Final Code

Here's what your final form code should look like. Remember to replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` and `YOUR_HONEYPOT_FIELD` with the appropriate values.

```html
<form action="https://api.comfyform.com/s/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="Full name" placeholder="John Doe">
    <input type="email" name="Email" placeholder="john@example.com">
    <textarea name="Message" placeholder="Hello, I'd like to..."></textarea>
    <!-- Start of a security code to prevent bot submissions -->
    <div style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">
        <label for="emailAgainHpInput">If you're huuuman, ignore this field</label>
        <input type="email" name="YOUR_HONEYPOT_FIELD" id="emailAgainHpInput" placeholder="your@email.com" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="nopls" data-1p-ignore data-lpignore="true">
    </div>
    <!-- End of security code -->
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Security Measures

The security field (honeypot) within the code is designed to be invisible to human users but detectable by bots. It's a simple yet effective spam protection mechanism that you must include in your form to maintain functionality.
