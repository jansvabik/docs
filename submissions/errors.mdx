This page details all possible errors our Submission API might return when you submit a form with the `Accept: application/json` header via JavaScript or your backend system. These errors typically indicate an issue with the form submission implementation or input provided by the end-user. Each error currently responds with a status code 400 Bad Request, assisting you in pinpointing and resolving the problem efficiently.
