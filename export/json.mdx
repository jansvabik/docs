## What's Included in the Export

A JSON export includes a comprehensive array of data for each submission, formatted as a list of objects. Each object represents a submission and encapsulates details such as submission ID, form ID, timestamp, submitter IP, country code, input fields with their respective responses, and file inputs with links to the uploaded files.
