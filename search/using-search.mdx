Harness the power of the search bar in Comfyform to **swiftly navigate through your forms and submissions**. This feature is designed to streamline your workflow by **instantly displaying results in an organized manner**. Simply type your query, and watch as the relevant forms and submissions populate under distinct headings for easy access.

## Searching for forms

Locate any form within your collection by entering keywords related to the form's name. Clicking on a form result will direct you to its dashboard page, where detailed form management can be conducted.

## Searching for submissions

Find specific submissions by inputting text matching any submission field value. Results show in a structured list, highlighting the exact field that contains your search term with a blue badge for clarity. Selecting a submission result opens a modal displaying all submission details.

## Recently searched

To enhance usability, your search queries are saved under the "Recently searched" section. This allows for **quick revisitation of past searches** without the need to re-type or remember the exact query.

## Recently viewed

Similar to "Recently searched," the "Recently viewed" section stores results you've clicked on. This feature facilitates easy access to forms and submissions you've recently examined, saving time and effort.
